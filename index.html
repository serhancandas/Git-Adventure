    <h1>Git Quiz</h1>
    <h4>What is Git and why is it so important?</h4>
    <p>Git is the most commonly used version control system. 
        Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done,
         and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. 
         Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by 
         multiple people to all be merged into one source.</p>

    <h4>What’s a branch and why do we create them?</h4>
    <p>The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, 
        
        and delete branches. It doesn’t let you switch between 
        branches or put a forked history back together again. </p>
   
    <h4>What’s the working tree?</h4>
    <p>The working tree, or working directory, consists of files 
        that you are currently working on. You can think of a working 
        tree as a file system where you can view and modify files.</p>

    <h4>What’s the staging area?</h4>
    <p>Staging area is files that are going to be a part of the next commit,
         which lets git know what changes in the file are 
         going to occur for the next commit. </p>
    
         <h4>What’s the command to retrieve the latest version 
        of your files from the remote serve?</h4>
        <p>git pull</p>
